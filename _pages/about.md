[CV](https://youngseobeum.github.io/files/cv.pdf) (last updated: Oct, 2022)

I am a geographer with special training in GIScience, working at the intersection of data science, human mobility, and environmental health. The interrelations between mobility, health, and social/natural environments are a particular focus of my research, as well as the environmental, health, economic, and racial disparities that exist in those relationships. My research projects have developed and applied statistical and computational methods to investigate the changes in mobility patterns associated with health, and the effects of social and natural environmental factors on the geographical disparity in population health. As a postdoctoral scholar in the department of city and regional planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am currently working on a research project that explores the impact of recent changes in healthcare policy on community transit system.
